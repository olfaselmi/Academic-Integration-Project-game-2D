# 2D Game Project

Welcome to my first academic project developed in 2019, a 2D Game built with [LANGUAGE/ENGINE]. This project was an exploration into game development, focusing on implementing various game mechanics such as collision detection, character movement, and AI interactions.

## Project Overview

The `game-2D` repository contains all the assets and code necessary to run the game. Each file serves a purpose, from rendering the game environment to handling the logic behind character interactions.

### Features

- Collision detection system.
- Character movement and controls.
- AI enemy behavior.
- Randomized puzzle generation and solving logic.
- Animated sprites for characters and backgrounds.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- List any prerequisites here (e.g., SDL library, specific compiler, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/olfaselmi/game-2D.git
